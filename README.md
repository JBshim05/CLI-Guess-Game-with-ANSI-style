# CLI-Guess-Game-with-ANSI-style

This is a number guessing game that computer pseudo randomly pick a number between 1 to 50 
and user have to guess what number did computer chose under 5 attempts.

>This code have been written with beginner knowledge of python.
Therefore, there will be a lot of unnecessary lines of code that have been included.
>>May update it to make the code looks nicer if I get better at python later
